# YoloProject
This project implements real-time car detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning algorithm. It uses Python and OpenCV along with a pre-trained YOLO model (YOLOv3 or YOLOv5) to identify and localize cars in images and webcam feeds.
YOLO is a fast and accurate object detection algorithm that frames detection as a regression problem. Unlike traditional methods, YOLO sees the entire image during training and testing, which results in faster predictions with fewer false positives.

In this project, we use a pre-trained YOLO model to detect cars in different environments. It processes images or video frames and outputs bounding boxes around detected cars along with confidence scores.
